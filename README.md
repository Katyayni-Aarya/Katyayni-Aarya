## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am Katyayni Aarya, a first-year B.Tech student with an extensive interest in developing innovative software solutions, cybersecurity, and Python programming. 
I am passionate about computer science and app development. I am currently working on projects like converting text from PDFs into editable formats, while also diving deeper into cybersecurity to understand how technology can be made safer. I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth in both technical and creative fields. 
As former deputy head girl, I also bring leadership experience and enjoy reading high-fantasy novels, particularly blending the themes of magic and technology.
